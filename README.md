# LoanZone
2019 Hackathon Project
--This was the initial progress on the Loan Zone Project--
Loan Zone is a peer-to-peer app where users can purchase and list monetary loans.
Loaners have control over how much they want to loan, the interest they will charge, and when payment is due.
Buyers can enter the amount they are looking to borrow and have the freedom to pick and choose from the criteria set by the loaners.
This app looks to be a breath of fresh air for consumers looking to avoid high, non negotiable interest rates and rigid deadlines set by bank policies.
